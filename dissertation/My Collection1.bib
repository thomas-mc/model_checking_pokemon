abstract = {Probabilistic model checking can overcome much of the complexity inherent in balancing games. Game balancing is the careful maintenance of relationships between the ways in which a game can be played, to ensure no single way is strictly better than all others and that players are offered a wide variety of ways to play successfully. We introduce a novel approach towards automating game balancing using probabilistic model checking called chained strategy generation (CSG). This involves generating chains of adversarial strategies which mimic the way players adapt their approach during repeated plays of a game. We use CSG to map out the evolving metagame. The trends identified can allow game developers to identify strategies which will be too strong and ways of playing the game which a player may want to use, but are never viable for successful competitive play. We introduce a case study, a game called RPGLite, and use CSG to compare five candidate configurations for the game. We show how to determine which configurations of RPGLite lead to a more fair and interesting experience for players. We also identify unexpected trends in how the strategies evolve. Our approach introduces a new technique for improving game development and player experience.},

abstract = {Probabilistic model checking is an automatic procedure for establishing if a desired property holds in a probabilistic model, aimed at verifying quantitative probabilistic specifications such as the probability of a critical failure occurring or expected time to termination. Much progress has been made in recent years in algorithms, tools and applications of probabilistic model checking , as exemplified by the probabilistic model checker PRISM (www.prismmodelchecker.org). However, the unstoppable rise of autonomous systems, from robotic assistants to self-driving cars, is placing greater and greater demands on quantitative modelling and verification technologies. To address the challenges of autonomy we need to consider collaborative, competitive and adversarial behaviour, which is naturally modelled using game-theoretic abstractions, enhanced with stochasticity arising from randomisation and uncertainty. This paper gives an overview of quantitative verification and strategy synthesis techniques developed for turn-based stochastic multi-player games, summarising recent advances concerning multi-objective properties and com-positional strategy synthesis. The techniques have been implemented in the PRISM-games model checker built as an extension of PRISM. 1 Introduction Probability is pervasive: it is used to quantify component failures, unreliable communication media and sensor imprecision, in randomised schemes to ensure efficiency of distributed coordination and resource management mechanisms, when dealing with environmental uncertainty , and to model performance and biological systems. Probabilistic model checking [48], also referred to as quantitative probabilistic verification, is an automated technique for verifying quantitative temporal logic properties of probabilistic models, which typically arise as extensions of Markov chains or Markov decision processes, additionally annotated with quantitative information such as time, energy or cost. The properties capture a variety of quantitative correctness, reliability or performance properties, and provide formal guarantees for properties such as "the maximum probability of the airbag failing to deploy within 0.02 seconds is at most 10 âˆ’10},

In this paper we illustrate its applicability to a complex biological system: the FGF (Fi-broblast Growth Factor) signalling pathway. We give a detailed description of how this case study can be modelled in the probabilistic model checker PRISM, discussing some of the issues that arise in doing so, and show how we can thus examine a rich selection of quantitative properties of this model. We present experimental results for the case study under several different scenarios and provide a detailed analysis, illustrating how this approach can be used to yield a better understanding of the dynamics of the pathway.},

abstract = {We present three case studies, investigating the use of probabilistic model checking to automatically analyse properties of probabilistic contract signing protocols. We use the probabilistic model checker PRISM to analyse three protocols: Rabin's probabilistic protocol for fair commitment exchange; the probabilistic contract signing protocol of Ben-Or, Goldreich, Micali, and Rivest; and a randomised protocol for signing contracts of Even, Goldreich, and Lempel. These case studies illustrate the general methodology for applying probabilistic model checking to formal verification of probabilistic security protocols. For the Ben-Or et al. protocol, we demonstrate the difficulty of combining fairness with timeliness. If, as required by timeliness, the judge responds to participants' messages immediately upon receiving them, then there exists a strategy for a misbehaving participant that brings the protocol to an unfair state with arbitrarily high probability, unless unusually strong assumptions are made about the quality of the communication channels between the judge and honest participants. We quantify the tradeoffs involved in the attack strategy, and discuss possible modifications of the protocol that ensure both fairness and timeliness. For the Even et al. protocol, we demonstrate that the responder enjoys a distinct advantage. With probability 1, the protocol reaches a state in which the responder possesses the initiator's commitment, but the initiator does not possess the responder's commitment. We then analyse several variants of the protocol, exploring the tradeoff between fairness and the number of messages that must be exchanged between participants.},

abstract = {The international standard IEEE 802.11 was developed recently in recognition of the increased demand for wireless local area networks. Its medium access control mechanism is described according to a variant of the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme. Although collisions cannot always be prevented , randomized exponential backoff rules are used in the retrans-mission scheme to minimize the likelihood of repeated collisions. More precisely, the backoff procedure involves a uniform probabilistic choice of an integer-valued delay from an interval, where the size of the interval grows exponentially with regard to the number of retransmissions of the current data packet. We model the two-way handshake mechanism of the IEEE 802.11 standard with a fixed network topology using probabilistic timed automata, a formal description mechanism in which both nonde-terministic choice and probabilistic choice can be represented. From our probabilistic timed automaton model, we obtain a finite-state Markov decision process via a property-preserving discrete-time semantics. The Markov decision process is then verified using Prism, a probabilistic model checking tool, against probabilistic, timed properties such as "at most 5,000 microseconds pass before a station sends its packet correctly."},
