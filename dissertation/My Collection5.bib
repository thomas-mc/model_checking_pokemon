abstract = {We show how detailed simulation models and abstract Markov modelscan be developed collaboratively to generate and implement effectivecontrollers for autonomous agent search and retrieve missions. Weintroduce a concrete simulation model of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV). We then show how the probabilistic model checker PRISM isused for optimal strategy synthesis for a sequence of scenariosrelevant to UAVs and potentially other autonomous agent systems. Foreach scenario we demonstrate how it can be modelled using PRISM,give model checking statistics and present the synthesised optimalstrategies. We then show how our strategies can be returned to thecontroller for the simulation model and provide experimental resultsto demonstrate the effectiveness of one such strategy. Finally weexplain how our models can be adapted, using symmetry, for use onlarger search areas, and demonstrate the feasibility of thisapproach.},
